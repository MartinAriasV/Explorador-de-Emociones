/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Emotion Explorer.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and diary entries.
 * Only authenticated users can create or modify their own data.
 * Emotions are publicly readable but cannot be created, updated, or deleted via the client.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information, with ownership determined by the {userId} path segment.
 * - /emotions/{emotionId}: Stores a predefined list of emotions, publicly readable.
 * - /users/{userId}/diaryEntries/{diaryEntryId}: Stores diary entries for a specific user, with ownership determined by the {userId} path segment.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User profiles can only be created by the user themselves.
 * - User profiles can only be modified or deleted by the user themselves.
 * - Diary entries can only be created, modified, or deleted by the user who owns the parent user profile.
 * - Emotions are publicly readable to provide a consistent set of options in the app.
 * - Listing of emotions is allowed.
 * - Listing of diary entries is restricted to the owner of the user profile.
 * - The rules do not enforce the specific schema of the data being written (data types, required fields), focusing on authorization.
 * - Uses path-based ownership checks to avoid costly `get()` calls in rules.
