/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and diary entries.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information, accessible only to the owning user.
 * - /users/{userId}/diaryEntries/{diaryEntryId}: Stores diary entries, accessible only to the owning user.
 * - /emotions/{emotionId}: Stores publicly accessible emotion definitions.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own profile data and diary entries.
 * - Emotions are publicly readable, but writes are not allowed.
 * - Listing all users is disallowed.
