/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the diary application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and diary entries,
 * ensuring that only the authenticated user can access their own data. Public read access is
 * granted to the /emotions collection.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}/userProfile: Stores user profile information, directly owned by the user.
 * - /users/{userId}/diaryEntries/{diaryEntryId}: Stores diary entries, also directly owned by the user.
 * - /emotions/{emotionId}: Stores global emotion definitions, publicly readable.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - The /emotions collection is publicly readable to allow clients to display available emotions.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `userId` is used in the path for both UserProfile and DiaryEntry for simple path-based ownership checks.
