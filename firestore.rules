/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Emotion Explorer.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Only the authenticated user who owns a document can read, create, update, or delete it.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile data, accessible only by the user.
 * - /users/{userId}/emotions/{emotionId}: Stores custom emotions, accessible only by the user.
 * - /users/{userId}/diaryEntries/{diaryEntryId}: Stores diary entries, accessible only by the user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own data. No cross-user data access is allowed.
 * - Listing operations are restricted to the owner of the data.
 * - Data validation is minimal in this prototype, focusing on ownership and relational integrity.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `userId` is encoded in the path for `emotions` and `diaryEntries` collections, which avoids the need for `get()` calls and simplifies security rules.
